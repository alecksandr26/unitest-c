# Description
***unittest c*** is a fast and simple macro-based unit testing framework for C. It's inspired by the Python unittest module and designed to reduce 
boilerplate code. With macros and a built-in test runner, it's ideal for large test suites.
# How to install it?
## Using `yay`
1. First, ensure that you have the yay package manager installed. You can install it [AUR(en)-yay](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yay).
2. Once yay is installed, you can search for the unittest-c package by running the following command:
```
yay -Ss unittest-c
```
3. If the package is found, you can proceed to install it by running the following command:
```
yay -S unittest-c
```
4. If the package is not found, you may need to update your package list by running the following command:
```
yay -Syu
```
That's it! After completing these steps, unittest-c should be installed on your system and ready to use.

## Using `make`
1. Clone the ***unittest-c repository*** from ***GitHub*** using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/alecksandr26/unittest-c.git
```
2. Change into the ***unittest-c*** directory:
```
cd unittest-c
```
3. ***Compile*** the unittest-c framework using make:
```
make compile
```
4. ***Install unittest-c*** to your system by running:
```
sudo make install
```
This will copy the ***unittest-c*** executable to your system's default binary directory, which should be in your PATH. You may be prompted to enter your
password for authentication.
5. Optionally, run the test to verify that the installation was successful:
```
make example_test_installed
```
That's it! After completing these five steps, unittest-c should be installed on your system and ready to use.
