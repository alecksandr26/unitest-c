  @file unittest_tfile.h
  @brief Defines the interface for managing test files. It includes the definition of the F struct,
  which represents a test file, as well as the maximum number of files and suits that can be stored.
  It also provides function prototypes for getting the creation time of a file and attaching a file
  to the test suite.
  The unittest_head_files variable is declared as extern to allow access to it from other modules.
